(defn apply-at
  "Scheduled function appliction. Works identically to apply, except
   that it takes an additional initial argument: ms-time. If ms-time is
   in the future, function application is delayed until that time, if
   ms-time is in the past function application is immediate.

   If you wish to apply slightly before specific time rather than
   exactly at it, see apply-by.

   Can be used to implement the 'temporal recursion' pattern. This is
   where a function has a call to apply-at at its tail:

   (defn foo
     [t val]
     (println val)
     (let [next-t (+ t 200)]
       (apply-at next-t #'foo [next-t (inc val)])))

   (foo (now) 0) ;=> 0, 1, 2, 3...

   The fn foo is written in a recursive style, yet the recursion is
   scheduled for application 200ms in the future. By passing a function
   using #'foo syntax instead of the symbole foo, when later called by
   the scheduler it will lookup based on the symbol rather than using
   the instance of the function defined earlier. This allows us to
   redefine foo whilst the temporal recursion is continuing to execute.

   To stop an executing temporal recursion pattern, either redefine the
   function to not call itself, or use (stop)."
